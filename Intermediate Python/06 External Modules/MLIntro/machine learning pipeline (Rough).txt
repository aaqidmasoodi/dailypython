Machine Learning PipeLine (Rough)
- Importing the Data
* This Step involves importing the data set.
* You can use the pandas library to achieve this

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Cleaning the data
* This involves getting the data set ready and in a
 usuable form.
* you could select a region of interest, maybe drop the duplicates, etc, etc
* you must also indentify the Input and Output set.

- Analysing the data set
* using various techniques, we can try to analyse the data set
 by plotting various parameters with other to get a sense of nature of the data
* based on our analysis we can try to select the proper algorithms.

- Spliting the data into training set and testing set
* we must split the data set into testing and traing so that we 
can know how accurate out model is later on

- Training the model
* we must use the trainig data to traig the model

- Making predictions
* the testing input can be used to ask the model for Output

- Checking the accuracy
* once we have the predictions, we can compare it with the testing Output

- Saving the model
* often times, training the model can take very long
 hence, once we have trained the model, we can also save it.
